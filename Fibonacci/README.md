# Fibonacci
Finds the *n*-th Fibonacci, where *n* is an integer.

## How it Works
This app asks for an integer value *n* and calculates the *n*-th Fibonacci number recursively.
- **NOTE:** the number returned is an integer, so the highest number it can return without experiencing an overflow is 46. If the user enters a zero or negative value, the app will tell them to try again.
