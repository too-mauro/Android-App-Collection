# Display Employees
Shows sample employee data from a text file on a web server.

## How it Works
This app asks the user to insert a web link storing data for an employee's data. It expects said data to be in the following order: name (string), ID (string), salary (double), office building and number (string), phone extension number (string), and years of service (integer). It returns the data along with an average salary (double) and an average years of service (double). There are two links that work with this app:
	- [Sample Text File 1](https://web.njit.edu/~halper/it114/l2d.txt)
	- [Sample Text File 2](https://web.njit.edu/~jdm68/it114/lab2.txt)
- NOTE: This app is also limited to only 3 people, since the data is stored in an array of size 18 (6 data items per person)! Both links must be written exactly as shown or else the app will crash.
