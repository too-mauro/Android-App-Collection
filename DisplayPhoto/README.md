# Display Photo
A static image viewer powered by Facebook's Fresco library.

## How it Works
This app asks for a web link to an image file, much like the **Display Employees** app. There are two links that work with this app:
	- [Mountain View](https://web.njit.edu/~halper/p5.jpg)
	- [Siblings in the Park](https://web.njit.edu/~jdm68/siblings.jpg)
- **NOTE:** Both links must be written exactly as shown or else the app will crash.
