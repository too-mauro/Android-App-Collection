# Integer Sorter
A simple number sorter.

## How it Works
This app asks for a file of integers, sorts them from smallest to largest, and writes them to a user-defined file on the device's internal storage much like the **E to X** app. This also displays the number of integers, its spread (highest number - lowest number), the root mean square of all the integers, and the median value.
- **NOTE:** There are two built-in asset files, **l5d.txt** and **grades.txt**, which can be used. This also can take up to 200 integer values.
