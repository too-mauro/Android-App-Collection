# E to X
A simple calculator for *e*^*x* values.

## How it Works
This app asks the user for a file with double values in them (for example, 5.35) and returns said values after being calcuated by *e*^*x*, where *x* is a value. It writes the calculated values to a user-defined file on the device/emulator's internal storage. (If the output file's box is empty, it won't write any data to the device; if the file already exists, the app will tell the user to delete the file before continuing.)
- NOTE: there are two built-in assets files, **nums1.txt** and **vals1.txt**, which can be used.
